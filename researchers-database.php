						<h2>No duds.</h2>
						<p>We often get asked about our database and itâ€™s a fair question. What we pride ourselves on is the quality of people whom we recruit. Lots of brands tout their millions of panelists, but in our experience, one thing matters most to our clients: how good the people are who respond. And, because sample sizes are naturally smaller when it comes to qual (vs. quant), all our clients really care about is how well matched our recruits are to their specs. </p>

						<p>Naturally, like many online brands, we skew younger vs. older. We are strong in the 18-49 demographic, but have done studies with teens as young as 13, and the oldest active person in our database is 71. We do work all over the world: US, Western Europe, Asia (mostly China, India, Japan) and Latin America (primarily Mexico & Brazil).</p>

					<h1>The MindSwarms difference</h1>
					<h2>We are OBSESSED with quality of recruit (visual multiple faces underneath)</h2>
					<p>When it comes to qualitative research, one thing matters above all: the quality of people who respond.</p>
					<p>How do we ensure quality insights from exceptional people? It starts with our database of respondents who were originally hand-picked by the founder of our company, Tom Bassett. Before founding MindSwarms, Tom was the founder of design and brand strategy firm Bassett & Partners; they work with world-class brands like Nike, Sonos, Microsoft, Intel and Subway who all demand the highest quality respondents.</p>
					<p>As MindSwarms scaled, we employed a few tricks of our own to help ensure the continued high quality of respondent:</p>

					<h3>Homophily</h3>
					<p>We invite great recruits to, in turn, invite their network to join because in our experience, great people know other great people (and the inverse is true too: duds will bring in other duds).</p>

					<h3>Free dud replacement</h3>
					<p>In the event a random dud gets through (it does happen) we replace them for free. We also flag duds to make sure they never get into another one of our studies again.</p>
