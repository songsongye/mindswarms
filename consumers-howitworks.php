						<h2>CREATE an account</h2>
						<p>Sign up on MindSwarms and begin creating your account. You can create an account using one of two ways. </p>
						<p>1) Here on the web platform using your laptop/desktop. <br />
						2) Using the MindSwarms app on iOS or Android operating system with your smartphone or tablet. Search for MindSwarms in the App Store or Google Play Store.</p>

						<p>Youâ€™ll record a profile video or two (to verify that your camera works well) and answer a few questions, then you can begin applying to surveys.</p>

						<h2>APPLY for a survey</h2>
						<p>Available surveys appear on your dashboard, waiting for you to apply. MindSwarms only shows you studies that you may qualify for based upon what you've shared with us about your age, gender, and geography. To apply for a survey, you'll answer a few multiple choice questions; a researcher will then review your responses and invite you to the survey if you qualify. The whole application process takes less than a minute (or about as long as it took to read this paragraph).</p>

						<h2>ANSWER Our Questions</h2>
						<p>Once you are invited to a survey, you'll be asked to answer up to 7 questions using the video function on your smartphone, tablet or webcam. It takes less than 10 minutes to record your answers; what you say will impact future products, advertising, and business decisions.</p>

						<h2>GET PAID for your Opinions</h2>
						<p>We pay you $50 via PayPal for every survey you complete. Payments are sent 24 hours after you complete a survey. If you don't have a PayPal account, it's easy to create one and transfer the payment to your bank account.</p>
